How to install & run model train & test scripts.

1. Install required libraries via 'pip install requirements.txt'

2. Run the jupyter notebook cells from data_vis_notebook.ipynb (note that the training took over 10 hours to run).

3. Evaluate test metrics in metrics.ipynb using the exported test set and model, if you would care to download the model separately (not uploaded on github since file to big) it's linked https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ezLEiU-3EGXMdJbGSQEeBUvAxPh0Xx4T/view?usp=drive_link.
